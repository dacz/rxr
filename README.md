RxR uses [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) to mimick Redux way of structuring (not only) a React app.

**Rewrite current react-redux app with RxJS/RxR is straightforward.**  You can leave most of the main code nearly intact when you learn RxJS with RxR.

**RxJS is great. Try it.**

RxR is a really tiny layer, mostly helpers. You don't need to use RxR or learn RxR specific syntax (except RxJS, but this is the aim). This is what I like on Redux a lot and this is what I wanted to have in RxR.

This is work in progress. Two packages ([rxr](https://github.com/dacz/rxr) and [rxr-react](https://github.com/dacz/rxr-react)). First versions. A lot to do. Opinions and help welcome.

Read more in [RxR docs](http://dacz.github.io/rxr) where you can see Redux and appropriate RxR code side by side and you will get into how (simple) RxR works thanks to RxJS.

**Here is demo app with docs about differences between Redux and RxR**: [rxr-redux-example](https://github.com/dacz/rxr-redux-example).

## Install

```
npm install --save rxr rxr-react
```
